Added new icon for current location. Wrote markdown file for this milestone.

Robert: 
 - Changed menu views and preference settings so distance choices effected map view. 
  - Potential profile UI bit that we probably don't wait too.

Since last week we connected to our final data source and added some 'suggested location' near the current loction. This week, we made the app mobile friendly(including map and menu) and got rid of the buttons we weren't using. Also, we imprved user interface.
