What are you trying to do?
    We want to create a site that lets people reduce the price of their Ubers
    
How is it done today, and what are the limits of the current practice?
    Currently the only way for people to think about their Uber prices are to guess. 
    If someone is in a populated area where a lot of people are calling Ubers then the 
    best that they could do is guess how far they can walk away to lessen the prices or way some period of time.
    
What's new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
    Our site is new because it is a way for users to visualize the Uber surge pricing in areas around them so that they
    can makes informed decisions on where and when they want to call a ride. This will be successful because previously
    this kind of data wasn't available to the average consumer.

Who cares? if you're successful, what difference will it make?
    If we are successful the average user will experience a significant cost reduction in the prices of their rides since
    they will have the information they need to make informed decisions about their Ubers.
