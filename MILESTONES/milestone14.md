Vincent: (Edited routing detail box to display relative pricing information to the end user. Made suggestion markers transparent based on user feedback.

Ruoqi: Adjusted the locations of markers to the bound of surge zones. Added screenshots to milestone file.

Sean: Started milestone file & description. Attemped various means to convert routing distance to imperial units; failed, undid changes. Attempted various means to display relative pricing information alongside user-defined waypoints; results unsatisfactory, undid changes. Attempted single means to resize settings input boxes relative to screen width, successful.

Robert: Worked on adding dynamic price tooltips to the routing on the map but it didn't work well at all in the mobile window since the tooltip just got covered by the routing anyway and that info is already in the routing.
