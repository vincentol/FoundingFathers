Vincent:
After going through many stack overflows, added a way to extract point data from hexagons, which is core for calculating how much money is saved.

Ruoqi: 
Improved UI and wrote part of milestone file

Sean:
Replaced arbitrary suggestion locations with realistic locations, considering only the nearest points in adjacent hexagons of lower surge value. Added functionality to calculate relative savings between an Uber hailed from the present location and an Uber hailed from a selected location based off point data from hexagons. Added short description in settings menu. Reformatted map legend to remove ambiguity and better convey surge multiplier tiers.

Robert: 
Didn't really add much this week.

Since last week we made the app mobile friendly(including map and menu) and got rid of the buttons we weren't using. This week, we added a way to extract point data from hexagons and printed fare information at console. Also, we improved user interface.
