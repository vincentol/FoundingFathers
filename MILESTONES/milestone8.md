This paper prototype adds a sharing feature by utilizing already
existing social networking apps. This would allow friends to share
their uber routes through messages, which could help them find cheaper
rides by finding friends to carpool with.

An ideal use of this UI would be: A group of friends split up into two
groups because different people wanted to do different things. In the end,
they want to meet up to share an uber back home. They can find a location to
meet up for the cheapest uber and send that location to each other with
a few taps from their fingers (or clicks on a laptop).

This prototype depicts the suggestion panel and help button.
The suggestion panel lists optimal choices for alternate locations, along with some details for each choice.
The help button opens a help overlay with general information concerning the app.

This prototype shows the main tooltip elements on the side of the mapo that give the user the information
that they need in order to fully understand their choices with the app. It also shows a really basic profile panel 
that could show users information on their usage of the app. The profile could ultimately show things like money saved
or popular routes.
