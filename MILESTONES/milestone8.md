This paper prototype adds a sharing feature by utilizing already
existing social networking apps. This would allow friends to share
their uber routes through messages, which could help them find cheaper
rides by finding friends to carpool with.

An ideal use of this UI would be: A group of friends split up into two
groups because different people wanted to do different things. In the end,
they want to meet up to share an uber back home. They can find a location to
meet up for the cheapest uber and send that location to each other with
a few taps from their fingers (or clicks on a laptop).
