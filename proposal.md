Project Title:


Summary: 
An intuitive way to compare ride fare prices for nearby areas, encouraging people to walk a little to save money.

Storyboard:


Feedback taken:
Our TA (Kandarp) says that we should consider whether or not if people would use this application (what incentive do they have).
We feel that encouraging a healthy lifestyle and saving money are two big incentives on their own (and on days where people don't want to save money, they don't have to take the suggested money-saving option).
However, we will look into more ways to encourage users to use this app.

Team K2 mentioned that we have to consider community traffic.

Team K5 stated that we should consider connect uber and this apps functionality.

In the end, we settled on this idea because it had a more general audience and solved a real problem that exists today (some things mentioned by the TA and other teams in person)
