Feedback taken:
Kandarp emphasizes the importance of providing incentives for people to use the app.
Our app informs users of potential discounts of significant value; this is sufficient incentive for anyone who values money.
Further incentives will be explored throughout the development process.

With the exception of team K2, all peer feedback on this idea was positive: "great idea", "very useful".
Team K2 asserted that "It would be difficult to determine what direction the user would have to go to".
This concern has been assessed, judged nonsensical, and accordingly discarded.

(Team 23 (K5) additionally suggested the possibility of integration with ride-hailing services.)

This idea was chosen for its general appeal and - as feedback affirms - its tangible usefulness.

Project's Features:
- Shows regions of increased pricing on a map (possibly color coded)
- Click on a region to show an estimated fare cost
- Suggests a pick-up location based on walking/money saving ratio

How programming work will be split:
Vincent - Front-end
